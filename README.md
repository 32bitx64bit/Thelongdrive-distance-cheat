# Thelongdrive-distance-cheat
A distance cheat for The long drive.

Installation. (WINDOWS SCROLL DOWN FOR LINUX INSTALLATION)
Download "The-long-drive-distance-cheat-.reg" double click it. Run the game, And enjoy!

Reason I made this repo is to make it easy for people who yk dont wanna waste their life spending hours to drive over 1k km in game so they can use a cheat menu, I highly disagree with the devs who put a limit on their cheat menu. As their reason was "so players can experience the game" which is total bs. 

Anyways, hope you enjoy! and happy cheating.

Linux installation:

Proton tricks -> default wine -> open regedit -> file -> import reg file, run game enjoy cheating.

Trouble shooting.
If it says invalid registry edit make sure to download it via the zip file, and not right clcik save as. As that causes issues. So just download it via zip ðŸ˜„
