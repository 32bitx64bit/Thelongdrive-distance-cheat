Alternatily download on my owng git instance
https://git.triro.net/gavinx2031/TLD-distance-cheat/releases

I also host Bad mod archive for TLD, https://git.triro.net/gavinx2031/TLD-bad-mod-archive It has full text converstations and everything *when avalible.* so if you're interested go check it out, as I wont be updating the bad bans section anymore here.

A distance cheat for The long drive.

Installation. (WINDOWS SCROLL DOWN FOR LINUX INSTALLATION)

Download the latest release under releases tab, run the .reg file included. And run the game.

Linux installation:

Proton tricks -> default wine -> open regedit -> file -> import reg file, run game enjoy cheating.

Trouble shooting.
If it says invalid registry edit make sure to download it via the zip file, and not right clcik save as. As that causes issues. So just download it via zip ðŸ˜„





Also the long drive community needs to grow up, this distance drove shit is legit such gate keeping.

Also I'm very aware of the TLD communities stance on "cheating", i dont really give a shit, their mod team is toxic af, more info about that in the special section for pancake and the other mods. ^-^



**WARNING FOR PIRATED USERS WHO PLAY THE GAME, THE MOD LOADER TARGETS THOSE WHO PIRATED THE GAME, IT'LL SPIT OUT A ERROR CALLED "error dll file mising, help" DO NOT ASK FOR HELP, THIS IS A WAY THEY BAN THEY BAN PEOPLE WHO USE PIRATED COPIES.**

Potential fix (this is old so idk it works anymore)  move TLD into  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Long Drive  (create folders when needed) as this should "trick" the mod loader into thinking its a legit copy.

Now ofc I dont endorse pirating a game, espicially from a small indie dev, but their stance on pirating by blocking users from modding is stupid its needless and doesn't make pirated users want to use a legit copy of the game.


Special section for pancake and the other mod(s) ^-^
Yeah safe to say terrible mod, banned someone for being a "nazi" when I checked their profile right after the ban nothing of the such was even found.
Warns people for no reason, will just warn you if you dare disagree with him. Also likes banning people for no reason, like quote "being anti furry" *even if the person WAS a furry LMAO*
Basically moral of the story, the mod team for TLD is full of terrible people who can't take any sort of critism , disagreement, or different views. Basically their in a eco chamber.
They also seem to ban people for having a black person as their profile, talk about racism from the mod team.
