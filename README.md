# Thelongdrive-distance-cheat
A distance cheat for The long drive.

Installation. (WINDOWS SCROLL DOWN FOR LINUX INSTALLATION)

Download the latest release under releases tab, run the .reg file included. And run the game.

Linux installation:

Proton tricks -> default wine -> open regedit -> file -> import reg file, run game enjoy cheating.

Trouble shooting.
If it says invalid registry edit make sure to download it via the zip file, and not right clcik save as. As that causes issues. So just download it via zip ðŸ˜„





Also the long drive community needs to grow up, this distance drove shit is legit such gate keeping.

Also I'm very aware of the TLD communities stance on "cheating", and its very toxic. But idrc as I'm not in the discord anymore, I left on my own accord.
